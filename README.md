Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google’s Gemini API, the chatbot supports text input, image input, and emoji-based interactions, making it more interactive and user-friendly.

This chatbot uses Google’s Gemini multimodal AI model, which can process both text and images, enabling the application to handle diverse types of user queries. The backend API integration allows real-time communication with Gemini, ensuring fast and context-aware responses. The system architecture is lightweight, secure, and optimized for smooth performance on web browsers.
